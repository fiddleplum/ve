# Render Stage Architecture

Every stage has a render texture as output and a scene as input. A render texture knows its own stage.
When you apply a render texture to a material, the material knows which scene it is apart of,
and tells the scene to add the render texture's stage as a dependency. Then when the stages
are sorted, the use the render texture/scene dependency graph to get the right ordering.
Research topological sorting.
